Project 2

Our program first asks for the user's name and age. It then, based on the input, determines whether or not the user is legally permitted to vote, smoke, or go to a casino. 

# Explanation of Program Name 

Our software, **Program Name** takes the user's inputted name and age and congratulates them on their longevity. It then analyzes a database of known legislation and determines the user's legal eligibility for certain age-restricted activities, including voting, smoking, and gambling. The purpose of this is to aid the user in knowing what kind of activities are available to them and to prevent them from making poor decisions.
